# Brain-games
Brain-games is a collection of five interactive games:
  - "Prime number" - player should answer if a given number is prime
  - "Progression" - player should guess a missed number in a given row of progression
  - "Greatest common divider" - player should answer about GCD of given two numbers
  - "Calculator" - player should input the result of simple operations for two numbers
  - "Even - odd" - player should answer if the number is even

Each game consists of three rounds "question - answer". If the player gives a wrong number he looses, after three correct answer he wins. The stream videos of all games ara embended bellow.

The package is created during educational courses at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io).
